## Phase 1: Planning & Architecture

1. **Define MVP Scope**
   - Finalize must-have features from the requirements document.
   - Identify which nice-to-haves can be deferred or modularized.

2. **Design System Architecture**
   - Choose tech stack: React + Tailwind (frontend), FastAPI or Node.js (backend), PostgreSQL, S3.
   - Define microservices: Auth, ESC management, Resume parser, Resume generator.
   - Plan infrastructure: Docker containers, CI/CD pipeline, Terraform for IaC.

3. **Model the Database**
   - Implement the ESC schema in PostgreSQL.
   - Create migration scripts and seed data for testing.

## Phase 2: Core Infrastructure & Authentication

4. **Set Up Project Repositories**
   - Create separate repos for frontend, backend, and parsing service.
   - Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

5. **Build Landing Page**
   - Design responsive frontpage with CTA and conversion funnel.
   - Add onboarding flow post-registration.

6. **Implement Authentication**
   - Integrate OAuth (Google, GitHub, Apple) and email/password login.
   - Secure endpoints with JWT and role-based access control.

## Phase 3: ESC Management

7. **Develop ESC CRUD Interfaces**
   - Backend: RESTful APIs for experiences, skills, tools, publications, certifications.
   - Frontend: Dynamic forms with validation and autosave.

8. **Implement Resume Parsing Service**
   - Build Python microservice using LLM or rule-based parser.
   - Accept PDF uploads and populate ESC fields.
   - Add manual override/editing capability.

9. **Add LinkedIn Integration (Optional)**
   - OAuth or URL-based scraping/enrichment.
   - Merge LinkedIn data into ESC with conflict resolution.

## Phase 4: Resume Generation Engine

10. **Design LaTeX Resume Template**
    - Create modular template with placeholders for ESC data.
    - Optimize for ATS readability and keyword matching.

11. **Build Resume Generator**
    - Match ESC data to job description relevance.
    - Exclude non-relevant roles, degrees, or skills.
    - Generate LaTeX source and compile to PDF.

12. **Implement PDF Preview & Export**
    - Render PDF in-browser using PDF.js or similar.
    - Enable download and versioning.

13. **Store Resume Versions**
    - Save generated resumes with metadata: job description, date, salary range.
    - Add dashboard for viewing and downloading past versions.

## Phase 5: Enhancements & Polish

14. **Salary Range Extraction**
    - Use NLP to parse salary info from job descriptions.
    - Store alongside resume metadata.

15. **Accessibility & UX Improvements**
    - Ensure WCAG compliance.
    - Add tooltips, autosuggestions, and keyboard navigation.

16. **Testing & QA**
    - Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end flows.
    - Manual testing for resume accuracy and parsing fidelity.

## Phase 6: Deployment & Showcase

17. **Deploy to Cloud**
    - Use AWS (EC2, RDS, S3, IAM) or alternative cloud provider.
    - Set up monitoring, logging, and backups.

18. **Create Demo Accounts**
    - Populate with sample ESCs and resumes for recruiters or portfolio viewers.

19. **Write Technical Documentation**
    - Include architecture overview, API docs, and design decisions.
    - Add README with setup instructions and feature highlights.
